Introduction
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Exchange EWS Protocol Test Suites are implemented as synthetic
clients running against a server-side implementation of a given Exchange
protocol. They are designed in a client-to-server relationship and were
originally developed for the in-house testing of Microsoft Open
Specifications. 

Microsoft Open Specifications were written using the normative
language defined in [RFC2119](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=117453), from which the
statements are extracted as protocol requirements to be
listed in the requirement specification in [Requirement specification](#requirement-specification). 

This document describes how Exchange EWS Protocol Test Suites are
designed to verify that the server behavior is in compliance
with normative protocol requirements in the technical
specification.

In a single test suite, similar or related requirements are grouped into one
test case, and the test cases on the same command or operation are
grouped into one scenario.

The technical specifications listed in the following table are included
in the Exchange EWS Protocol Test Suites package. The version of
technical specification MS-OXWSITEMID is v20150330 and the others are
v20121003.

Requirement specification
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

A requirement specification contains a list of requirements that are
extracted from statements in the technical specification. Each technical
specification has one corresponding requirement specification named as
MS-XXXX\_RequirementSpecification.xlsx, which can be found in the
Docs\\MS-XXXX folder in the Exchange EWS Protocol Test Suites package
with the technical specification.

The requirements are categorized as normative or informative. If the
statement of the requirement is required for interoperability, the
requirement is normative. If the statement of the requirement is for
a high-level introduction or clarification, and removal of the content
does not affect interoperability, the requirement is informative.

Each requirement applies to a specific scope: server, client, or both.
If the requirement describes a behavior performed by the responder, the
scope of the requirement is the server. If the requirement describes a
behavior performed by the initiator, the scope of the requirement is
the client. If the requirement describes a behavior performed by both the
initiator and responder, the scope of the requirement is for both the client and server.

The test suites cover normative requirements which describes a behavior
performed by the responder. For a detailed requirements list and
classification, see MS-XXXX\_RequirementSpecification.xlsx.

Design considerations
=====================

Assumptions
-----------

-   Exchange EWS Protocol Test Suites are not designed to run
    multi-protocol user scenarios, but rather to provide a way to exercise
    certain operations documented in a technical specification.

-   The test suites are functional tests that verify the compatibility
    of the system under test (SUT) with protocol implementation.

-   The test suites do not cover every protocol requirement and in no
    way certify implementation, even if all tests pass.

-   The test suites verify the server-side testable requirements. They
    do not verify the requirements related to client behaviors and
    server internal behaviors.

Dependencies
------------

-   All Exchange EWS Protocol Test Suites depend on the Protocol Test
    Framework (PTF) to derive managed adapters.

Package design
==============

Exchange EWS Protocol Test Suites are implemented as synthetic
clients running against server-side implementation of a given Exchange
protocol. The test suites verify the server-side and testable
requirements.

Architecture
------------

The following figure illustrates the Exchange EWS Protocol Test Suites
architecture.

![alt tag] (https://github.com/ClareMSYanGit/Interop-TestSuites/blob/EASDeployGuide/ExchangeWebServices/Docs/Doc-Images/EWS_Spec_Architecture.png)

**Figure 1: Architecture**

The following outlines the details of the test suites architecture:

**SUT**

The SUT hosts the server-side implementation of the protocol, which test
suites run against.

-   From a third-partyâ€™s point of view, the SUT is a
    server implementation.

-   The following products have been tested with the test suites on the
    Windows platform.

-   Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 3 (SP3)
-   Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 3 (SP3)
-   Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Service Pack 1 (SP1)

**Test Suite Client**

The test suites act as synthetic clients to communicate with the SUT and
validate the requirements gathered from technical specifications. The
Exchange EWS Protocol Test Suites include one common library, 10
adapters and nine test suites.

-   The test suites communicate with SUT via a protocol adapter and SUT
    control adapter to verify if the SUT behaves in the way that is
    compliant with normative protocol requirements.

-   Expect MS-OXWSITEMID adapter, all other protocol adapters
    communicate with SUT through the common library.

-   MS-OXWSITEMID protocol adapter implements the Web Service
    Item Algorithm. All other test suites use the MS-OXWSITEMID protocol
    adapter to parse and process the Id of an ItemId object in SOAP
    request and SOAP response.

Common library
--------------

The common library provides implementation of the transport layer,
common messages, structures, and helper methods.

### Transport classes

There is one transport class in the common library:
ExchangeServiceBinding.

The ExchangeServiceBinding transport class implements SOAP over HTTP and
SOAP over HTTPS communications between test suites and SUTs.

### Helper methods

The common library defines a series of helper methods. The helper
methods can be classified into following categories.

-   Access the properties in the configuration file.

-   Generate resource name.

-   Validate certificate used for authentication.

-   Other methods which are used by multiple test suites.

### Message structures

Except MS-OXWSITEMID, all protocols are SOAP protocols. Therefore the
message structures are used by multiple test suites. These message
structures are defined in the common library.

Adapter
-------

Adapters are interfaces between the test suites and the SUT. There are
two types of adapter: protocol adapter and SUT control adapter. In most
cases, modifications to the protocol adapter will not be required for
non-Microsoft SUT implementations. However, the SUT control adapter
should be appropriately configured to connect to a non-Microsoft SUT
implementation. All test suites in the package contain a protocol
adapter, three of them contain a SUT control adapter.

### Protocol Adapter

The protocol adapter is a managed adapter, which is derived from the
ManagedAdapterBase class in the PTF. It provides an interface that is
used by the test cases to construct protocol request messages that will
be sent to the SUT. The protocol adapter also acts as an intermediary
between the test cases and the transport classes, receiving messages,
sending messages, parsing responses from the transport classes, and
validating the SUT response according to the normative requirement in
the technical specification.

Except MS-OXWSITEMID, all other protocol adapters use
ExchangeServiceBinding transport class defined in the common library to
send and receive messages. MS-OXWSITEMID protocol adapter implements the
Web Service Item Algorithm which describes the format of the Id and how
to process it. All other test suites use the MS-OXWSITEMID protocol
adapter to parse and process the Id of an ItemId object in SOAP request
and SOAP response.

### SUT Control Adapter 

The SUT control adapter manages all the control functions of the test
suites that are not associated with the protocol. For example, the setup
and tear down are managed through the SUT control adapter. The SUT
control adapter is designed to work with the Microsoft implementation of
the SUT. However, it is configurable to allow the test suites to run
against non-Microsoft implementations of the SUT.

There are three protocols that have a SUT control adapter in the
Exchange EWS Protocol test suites package: MS-OXWSBTRF, MS-OXWSSYNC and
MS-OXWSMSG..

Test suite
----------

The test suites verify the server-side and testable requirements listed
in the requirement specification. The test suites call the protocol
adapter to send and receive message between the protocol adapter and the
SUT, and call the SUT control adapter to change the SUT state. The test
suites consists of a series test cases which are categorized to several
scenarios.
