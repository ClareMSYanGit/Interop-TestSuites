Introduction
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites are implemented as synthetic
clients running against a server-side implementation of a given Exchange
protocol. They are designed in a client-to-server relationship and were
originally developed for the in-house testing of the Microsoft Open
Specifications. Test suites have been used extensively in Plugfests and
Interoperability Labs to test partner implementations.

This document describes how the Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites are
designed to verify that the server behaves in the way that is compliant
with normative protocol requirements as described in the technical
specification.

The Microsoft Open Specifications were written using the normative
language defined in
[*RFC2119*](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=117453). The
statements of them are extracted as protocol requirements which are
listed in the requirement specification described in section 2. The test
suites are developed to test the normative protocol requirements. In a
single test suite, similar or related requirements are grouped into one
test case, and the test cases about same command or operation are
grouped into one scenario.

The technical specifications listed in the following table are included
in the Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites package. The version of these
technical specifications is v20150630.

Requirement specification
======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

A requirement specification contains a list of requirements that are
extracted from statements in the technical specification. Each technical
specification has one corresponding requirement specification named as
MS-XXXX\_RequirementSpecification.xlsx, which can be found in the
Docs\\MS-XXXX folder in the Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites package
together with the technical specification.

The requirements are categorized as normative or informative. If the
statement of the requirement is required for interoperability, the
requirement is normative. If the statement of the requirement is
clarifying information or high-level introduction, and removal of it
does not affect interoperability, the requirement is informative.

Each requirement applies to a specific scope: server, client, or both.
If the requirement describes a behavior performed by the responder, the
scope of the requirement is server. If the requirement describes a
behavior performed by the initiator, the scope of the requirement is
client. If the requirement describes a behavior performed by both
initiator and responder, the scope of the requirement is both.

The test suites cover normative requirements which describes a behavior
performed by the responder. For a detailed requirements list and
classification, see the MS-XXXX\_RequirementSpecification.xlsx.

Design considerations
=====================

Assumptions
-----------

-   The Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites are not designed to run
    multi-protocol user scenarios, but rather provide a way to exercise
    certain operations documented in a technical specification.

-   The test suites are functional tests that verify the compatibility
    of the system under test (SUT) with a protocol implementation.

-   The test suites do not cover every protocol requirement and in no
    way certify an implementation, even if all tests pass.

-   The test suites verify the server-side testable requirements; they
    do not verify the requirements related to client behaviors and
    server internal behaviors.

-   The test suites assumes that there is a shared folder on the server.

-   The test suites assumes that there is a hidden folder and a visible
    folder under the shared folder.

-   The test suites assumes that there is a hidden document and a
    visible document under the shared folder.

-   The test suites assumes that authentication has been performed by
    the underlying protocols.

Dependencies
------------

-   All Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites depend on the Protocol Test
    Framework (PTF) to derive managed adapters.

-   All Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites depends on the HTTP protocol
    or HTTPS protocol to transmit the messages.

-   All Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites depends on MS-ASWBXML to
    encode XML requests bodies into WBXML for transmission to an
    ActiveSync server.

-   All Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites depends on MS-ASHTTP to
    synchronize the data which is stored on the server.

-   All Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites depends on the xsd.exe tool in
    the .NET Framework SDK to generate structures used in the MS-ASCAL
    request and response.

Package design
==============

The Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites are implemented as synthetic
clients running against a server-side implementation of a given Exchange
protocol. The test suites verify the server-side and testable
requirements.

Architecture
------------

The following figure illustrates the Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites
architecture.

**Figure 1: Architecture**

The following outlines the details of the test suites architecture:

**SUT**

The system under test (SUT) hosts the server-side implementation of the
protocol, which test suites run against.

-   From a third-partyâ€™s point of view, the SUT is a
    server implementation.

-   The following products have been tested with the test suites on the
    Windows platform.

<!-- -->

-   Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 3 (SP3)

-   Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 3 (SP3)

-   Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Service Pack 1 (SP1)

-   Microsoft Exchange Server 2016

**Test Suite Client**

The test suites act as synthetic clients to communicate with the SUT and
validate the requirements gathered from technical specifications. The
Exchange EAS Protocol Test Suites include one common library, 13
adapters and 12 test suites.

-   The test suites communicate with SUT via a protocol adapter and SUT
    control adapter to verify if the SUT behaves in the way that is
    compliant with normative protocol requirements.

-   All protocol adapters uses ActiveSyncClient to send command request
    and retrieve command response.

-   ActiveSyncClient encodes and decodes commands defined in
    \[MS-ASCMD\] by using MS-ASWBXML and communicates with the SUT
    via MS-ASHTTP.

Common library
--------------

The common library provides implementation of the ActiveSyncClient,
messages, structures, and helper methods.

### ActiveSyncClient

The ActiveSyncClient works as an intermediary between the protocol
adapter and SUT. The protocol adapter calls ActiveSyncClient to connect,
disconnect, and execute commands. The ActiveSyncClient passes the
protocol adapter requests and sends the protocol adapter request to the
SUT. The ActiveSyncClient receives the response from the SUT and sends
the response back to the protocol adapter.

### Helper methods

The common library defines a series of helper methods. The helper
methods can be classified into following categories.

-   Access the properties in the configuration file.

-   Generate resource name.

-   Other methods which are used by multiple test suites.

### Message structures

Becuase the C\# proxy class is used by the multiple test suites. So the
the C\# proxy class is defined in the common library.

Adapter
-------

Adapters are interfaces between the test suites and the SUT. There are
two types of adapter: protocol adapter and SUT control adapter. In most
cases, modifications to the protocol adapter will not be required for
non-Microsoft SUT implementations. However, the SUT control adapter
should be appropriately configured to connect to a non-Microsoft SUT
implementation. All test suites in the package contain a protocol
adapter, six of them contain a SUT control adapter.

### Protocol Adapter

The protocol adapter is a managed adapter, which is derived from the
ManagedAdapterBase class in the PTF. It provides an interface that is
used by the test cases to construct protocol request messages that will
be sent to the SUT. The protocol adapter also acts as an intermediary
between the test cases and the transport classes, receiving messages,
sending messages, parsing responses from the transport classes, and
validating the SUT response according to the normative requirement in
the technical specification.

All protocol adapters use ActiveSyncClient transport classes defined in
the common library to send and receive messages.

### SUT Control Adapter 

The SUT control adapter manages all the control functions of the test
suites that are not associated with the protocol. For example, the setup
and tear down are managed through the SUT control adapter. The SUT
control adapter is designed to work with the Microsoft implementation of
the SUT. However, it is configurable to allow the test suites to run
against non-Microsoft implementations of the SUT.

There are four protocols that have a SUT control adapter in the Exchange
EAS Protocol test suites package: MS-ASCMD, MS-ASHTTP, MS-ASPROV and
MS-ASRM.

Test suite
----------

The test suites verify the server-side and testable requirements listed
in the requirement specification. The test suites call the protocol
adapter to send and receive message between the protocol adapter and the
SUT, and call the SUT control adapter to change the SUT state. The test
suites consists of a series test cases which are categorized to several
scenarios.

### MS-ASAIRS
